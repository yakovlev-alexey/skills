# Agent Config In Dotfiles

## Rule

Agent configuration must be changed through the dotfiles repository, not by editing live generated files directly.

Canonical repository:

```text
$HOME/Repos/dotfiles
```

If that path does not exist, check these fallbacks before editing live config:

```text
/Users/yakovlev-alex/Repos/dotfiles
/home/yakovlev-alex/Repos/dotfiles
```

## What Counts As Agent Configuration

Use this skill for changes to:

- MCP servers, MCP auth wiring, generated `mcp.json`, or Codex `mcp_servers`.
- Skills, external skill registries, local skill folders, skill projections, or skill installation scripts.
- Plugins, local plugin marketplaces, plugin manifests, or plugin installation scripts.
- `AGENTS.md`, instruction files, global agent rules, prompt/instruction layers.
- Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Claude, or similar agent client config.
- Approval rules, sandbox rules, automation config, or agent tool/runtime settings.

## Workflow

1. Go to `$HOME/Repos/dotfiles`.
2. Edit the canonical source:
   - instructions: `ai/instructions/*.md`
   - generated `AGENTS.md`: run `./scripts/build-agents-md`
   - MCP: `ai/mcp.json`, then `./scripts/install-mcp`
   - public local skills: `ai/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, then `./scripts/install-skills`
   - external skills: `ai/skills.json`, then `./scripts/install-skills`
   - plugins: `ai/plugins/plugins.json`, then `./scripts/install-plugins`
   - Codex config template: `codex/*.template.toml`
   - OpenCode config template: `opencode/*.template.json`
3. Run validation:

```bash
./scripts/check
```

4. Review the diff:

```bash
git diff
git status --short
```

5. Commit and push the dotfiles change:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Update agent configuration"
git push
```

## Guardrails

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, auth files, sessions, history, caches, SQLite files, or generated runtime state.
- Do not edit generated live files as the source of truth. If a live file must be regenerated for local use, regenerate it from dotfiles scripts.
- If the requested change came from experimenting in a live agent UI, promote the final desired state back into dotfiles before considering the task complete.
- If there is no git remote yet, still commit locally and tell the user that push is blocked by missing remote.
